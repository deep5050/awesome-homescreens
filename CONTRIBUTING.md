**You should not upload:**
- screenshots with any personal images as wallpaper.
- screenshots with any personal information visible.
- Any text or images that harm any religions' believe.
- Any harmful widget scripts.


**Steps to contribute:**
- create a directory as `[username]` (example: deep5050) under a suitable category (feel free to suggest a new category).
- place necessary files there (wallpaper,custom widget scripts,fonts or even APKs).
- create a `readme.md` 

The readme template is: 

```md

![alt](./path/to/your/screenshot)

| Name  | [optional name]  |
|:-:|:-:|
| Launcher   | *[launcher name] |
| Icon Pack  |*[Icon pack app]   |
| Widget Manager   | [widget manager app name]  |
|  widget | [custom widget app/ scripts]  |
| wallpaper  |[wallpaper app/ upload a wallpaper/a permanent link]  |
| Font  | [Font name / upload a font ]   |
| User Repo| https://github.com/username |

```
- If you have multiple setups to upload, create subdirectories under your `username` directory. example: `deep5050/1` , `deep5050/2`
- Finally do an entry in the root `readme.md` under appropriate category. **Maintain alphabetical order** Template is below:


```
  <details>
    <summary>[USER NAME] </summary>
    <p align=center><a href="./path/to/target directory"><img src="./path/to/screenshot directory" height=400px width=225px></a></p>

  </details>
```


**HAPPY CONTRIBUTING :)**
