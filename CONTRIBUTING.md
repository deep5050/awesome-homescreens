**You should not upload:**
- screenshots with any personal images as wallpaper.
- screenshots with any personal information visible.
- Any text or images that harm a group's religious beliefs.
- Any harmful widget scripts.


**Steps to contribute:**
- create a directory as `[username]` (example: `deep5050`) under a suitable category (feel free to suggest a new category).
- If you have multiple setups to upload, create subdirectories under your `username` directory. example: `deep5050/1` , `deep5050/2`
- place necessary files there (wallpaper,custom widget scripts,fonts or even APKs).
- create a `readme.md` 

The readme template is: 

```md



|      screen      |                    ![alt](./path/to/your/screenshot) |
|       :-:        |                                :-:                   |
|    Launcher      |            [launcher name *( mandatory) ]            |
|     Icon Pack    |                [Icon pack app *( mandatory) ]        |
|  Widget Manager  |                           [widget manager app name]  |
|      widget      |                        [custom widget app/ scripts]  |
|     wallpaper    | [wallpaper app/upload a wallpaper/a permanent link]  |
|     Font         |                       [Font name / upload a font ]   |
|    User Repo     |                          https://github.com/username |

```

- Finally do an entry in the root `readme.md` under appropriate category. **Maintain alphabetical order** Template is below:


```
  <details>
    <summary>[USER NAME]</summary>
    <p align=center><a href="./path/to/target directory"><img src="./path/to/screenshot directory" ></a></p>

  </details>
```


**HAPPY CONTRIBUTING :)**
