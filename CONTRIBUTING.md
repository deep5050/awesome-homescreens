**You should not upload:**
- screenshots with any personal images as wallpaer.
- screenshots with any personal information visible.
- Any text or images that harm any religions' believe.
- Any harmful widget scripts.


**Steps to contribute:**
- create a directory as `[username]` (example: deep5050) under a suitable category.
- place necessary files there (wallpaper,custom widget scripts,fonts or even APKs).
- create a `readme.md` 

The readme template is:

```md

![alt](./path/to/your/screenshot)

| Name  | [optional name]  |
|:-:|:-:|
| Launcher  | *[launchername] |
| Icon Pack  |*[Icon pack app]   |
|Widget Manager   | [widget manaer app name]  |
|  widget | [custom widget app/ scripts]  |
| wallpaer  |[wallpaper app/ upload a wallpaer/a permenent link]   |
| Font  |[Font name/ upload a font]   |
| wallpaer  |[wallpaper app/ upload a wallpaer/a permenent link]   |
|User Repo| [[your github repo link]|

```
- If you have multiple setup to upload, create subdirectories as `non-decresing number` under your `username` directory. example: `deep5050/1` , `deep5050/2`
- Finally do an entry in the root `readme.md`. **Maintain alphabetical order**


** HAPPY CONTRINUTING :)**
